# What is this site about?

This website is about a company that sells custom made statues. The main idea is you can send an image of a loved one along with your order and they'll recreate it for you and ship it. This could get really popular for birthday gifts or for business decorations. 

I've followed a grey and black color template to make the design resemble the statue color, and added some animations on the go to make it feel more modern. I've added 3 pages (home/contact/about) to keep it simple and easy to navigate through. I've also paid attention to call to action buttons and made them stand out a bit when hovered so it could promote better conversions.

# Why I created it

This website was really fun to make. The figma design was laying there for a while, and I thought to myself that I'd love to polish my html/css/javascript skills along with the aos library. This has helped write better code and understand design flow, as I had to make sure all components needed to have the same sizing on different pages.

# What I want to create next

I'm going to upload a bootstrap website really soon, and then I'm going to jump back into fullstack website. The first fullstack website I have in mind is a JOB POST SITE. I'll also have to use puppeteer.js for webscraping to fill it with genuine posts!

# Figma Design
A while ago I used to design websites while coding them. But learning figma helped me save alot of time and effort rewriting code. If anyone is in the same position where they're procrastinating on learning a design editor, then my advice would be to just jump into it!

It'll only take an hour or two to fully know what you're doing with it. Here's the figma design I came up with before diving into coding.
